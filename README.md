#Products CRUD app

Backend CRUD Application for Product Management (Node.js & Express)

This project is a backend-only RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js, designed to perform core CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—for managing product data. It serves as a foundational backend service that can be integrated with various frontend frameworks or used independently for managing product-related information in a database.

Key Features:
Create (Add): Add new products with attributes such as name, price, description, and category.

Read (Retrieve): Fetch single or multiple product entries via well-structured API endpoints.

Update: Modify existing product details using product IDs.

Delete: Remove products from the system securely and efficiently.

Technical Stack:
Node.js: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.

Express.js: Lightweight web framework used to handle routing and middleware for API endpoints.

RESTful Architecture: Adheres to REST principles for scalable and maintainable API design.

Middleware Integration: Uses Express middleware for request parsing, error handling, and logging.

Use Cases:
Product inventory management systems.

E-commerce backend services.

Educational projects and development boilerplates.

This backend service is ideal for developers seeking a clean, modular starting point for product management functionality in full-stack applications.
